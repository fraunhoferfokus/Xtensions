== Extensions to PrimitiveIterators

The primitive iterators defined in the JDK as sub-interfaces of `java.util.PrimitiveIterator` 
do not provide combinators like the ones provided by Xtend. These combinators, however, do take some 
efforts to implement. Instread, this library provides the class 
`de.fhg.fokus.xtensions.iteration.PrimitiveIteratorExtensions` provides methods to 
create primitive streams (from `java.util.stream`) for the remaining elements of a given iterator via the 
extension methods `streamRemaining` or `parallelStreamRemaining`.
