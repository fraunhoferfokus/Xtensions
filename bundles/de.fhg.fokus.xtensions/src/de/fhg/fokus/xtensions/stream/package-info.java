/**
 * This package contains classes providing extension methods for the JDK class
 * {@link java.util.stream.Stream Stream}. Some of the extension methods provide
 * functionality known from Xtend's Iterator/Iterable extension methods to make
 * the experience of using {@code Stream}s more naturally with Xtend. Other
 * extension methods make use of the feature that extension methods in Xtend can
 * be defined on specialized generic types; the class
 * {@link de.fhg.fokus.xtensions.stream.StringStreamExtensions
 * StringStreamExtensions} provide extension methods on {@code Stream<String>}.
